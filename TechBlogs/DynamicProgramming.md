# The Dynamic way to solve a dynamic problem
As I am learning Dynamic Programming I want to tell myself upto where i have learned.
Basically To solve a problem which involves to check all the possible cases of answers we use recursion.
But going with bare recursion is not an optimised way to solve a problem as the time complexity of it is exponential so basically we should optimise the bare recursion process.
> GeneralRecursion -> Memoization -> Tabulation -> Further Space optimisation -> Damn Perfect/Efficeient Solution :)
 
An Important Strategey to solve a DP problem is based on three steps:
1) Explain the problem in terms of index (As most of the questions involves indices)
2) Workout all the possible ways on that index
3) Get the answer based on the given scenerio.
