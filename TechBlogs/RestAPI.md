# Things I know About RestAPI'S :)

1. First of all REST(restful API's) is a set of rules we should follow to create a HTTP API'S for a service or Application (maybe for our project).
2. Like when we send the http request to a server we mention get/post/put/or delete in the request essentially those are the crud operations in order to perform some operations on the application resuorces.
3. When we build an api we will write that api in the way it should respond accordingly to the crud operatios mentioned int he request.
4. The way of building that api or the set of rules that we follow to build the API is known as restful or the  REST'API.
5. Check my Repository to build A REST API in node and expressJS (a framework for node js)
